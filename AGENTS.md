# AGENTS.md — THINK BOX AI

**Purpose:** This file defines the rules that every agent (human or AI) working
on this repository must follow. It is the operational layer of the architecture
defined in `docs/architecture-v1.md`.

---

## 1. Architecture Principles

These are non-negotiable. Violating them requires a decision record.

### 1.1 Layer Discipline

The system has five layers (Foundation, Provider, Memory, Governance/Tools,
Runtime). A layer may only import from layers beneath it. Cross-layer imports
are architectural errors.

**Check:** Before committing, verify imports with:
`python3 -c "import ast,sys; [print(f) for f in sys.argv[1:] if True]"` or manual
review.

### 1.2 Provider Independence

No model provider is hardcoded. The runtime must work identically with:
- OpenAI-compatible APIs (OpenAI, Together, vLLM, Ollama)
- Anthropic Messages API
- Local models (Phase 2+)

Swapping a provider is a configuration change, not a code change.

**Rule:** Never import a provider-specific SDK at the runtime layer. The
runtime only knows the `ModelProvider` protocol.

### 1.3 Memory First

Memory is not a chat history. It has four layers: Session, Task,
Organizational, Verified Knowledge. Each has a distinct scope, lifetime, and
write policy.

**Rule:** Never store transient UI state in memory. Never store speculative
claims in Organizational Memory.

### 1.4 Governance by Default

Tools do not execute without permission checks. Audit logs are append-only.
Approval gates are opt-out, not opt-in.

**Rule:** A tool without an explicit `permission` level is `RESTRICTED` and
requires approval.

### 1.5 Evidence Over Assumptions

Claims about model performance, tool reliability, or system behavior must be
backed by measurements stored in Organizational Memory.

**Rule:** Never commit a claim like "Model X is better" without a benchmark
result in `benchmarks/`.

---

## 2. Coding Rules

### 2.1 Language

- **Core:** Python 3.10+
- **CLI wrapper (future):** TypeScript/Node (deferred)
- **No other languages** without a decision record.

### 2.2 Dependencies

- Phase 0: Python standard library only.
- Every external dependency must have a documented trigger (see
  `docs/project-foundation.md` §4).
- No "maybe we'll need it" imports.

### 2.3 Style

- Follow PEP 8.
- Use type hints on all public functions and methods.
- Use `dataclasses` for data structures (Phase 1). Add `pydantic` when
  schemas stabilize.
- Docstrings on all public classes and functions.
- No comments that explain *what* the code does. Comments explain *why*.

### 2.4 Async

- The runtime is async (`asyncio`). All I/O-bound operations must be async.
- Blocking operations must be explicitly marked and isolated.

### 2.5 Error Handling

- Never swallow exceptions silently.
- All errors carry: `agent_id`, `task_id`, `think_box_id`, `timestamp`,
  `error_type`, `context`.
- The runtime raises structured errors. It does not log and continue.

### 2.6 Logging

- Use `logging` from stdlib.
- Log levels: `DEBUG` (internal state), `INFO` (significant events),
  `WARNING` (recoverable issues), `ERROR` (failures).
- Never log secrets, tokens, or PII.

---

## 3. Testing Requirements

### 3.1 Test Coverage

- Phase 1 target: 80% coverage for `core/` and `core/tools/`.
- Tests run in CI. No PR merges without passing tests.

### 3.2 Test Structure

```
tests/
  unit/           # Pure logic, no I/O, no network
  integration/    # Memory store, provider HTTP client, tool execution
  e2e/            # Full runtime loop with a mock provider
```

### 3.3 Test Requirements

- Every public function has at least one test.
- Every error path has a test.
- Tools have tests for: valid input, invalid input, permission denied,
  approval required.
- Memory has tests for: write, read, delete, conflict, retention.

### 3.4 Test Commands

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/          # Fast, no I/O
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/   # Requires SQLite
python3 -m pytest tests/                # All tests
```

### 3.5 Mocking

- Mock providers in unit tests. Do not make real HTTP calls.
- Use `unittest.mock` from stdlib. No external mocking libraries in Phase 1.

## 4. Documentation Requirements

### 4.1 What Must Be Documented

| Artifact | Location | Required |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Architecture | `docs/architecture-v1.md` | Yes |
| Project foundation | `docs/project-foundation.md` | Yes |
| Decision records | `docs/decisions/NNN-*.md` | Yes (for every ADR) |
| Module docstrings | In-code | Yes |
| Public API docstrings | In-code | Yes |
| Setup guide | `docs/guides/setup.md` | Phase 1 |
| Tool authoring guide | `docs/guides/tools.md` | Phase 1 |

### 4.2 Decision Records

Every significant decision gets a record:

```
docs/decisions/
  001-*.md   # First decision
  002-*.md   # Second decision
  ...
```

Format:

```markdown
# ADR NNN: Title

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Accepted | Rejected | Superseded

## Context
What problem are we solving?

## Options Considered
1. Option A
2. Option B

## Decision
We chose Option X because...

## Consequences
What changes as a result?
```

---

## 5. Decision Recording Process

1. **Draft:** Author writes the ADR before implementing the decision.
2. **Review:** At least one other contributor reviews.
3. **Accept:** ADR is marked `Accepted` and committed with the implementation.
4. **Supersede:** If a later decision invalidates an ADR, mark it
   `Superseded` and reference the new ADR.

ADRs are never deleted. They are historical records.

---

## 6. Branching and Commits

### 6.1 Branch Naming

```
feat/phase-N-description   # New feature or phase
fix/NNN-description        # Bug fix, references ADR if applicable
docs/description           # Documentation only
refactor/description       # Code restructuring, no behavior change
```

### 6.2 Commit Messages

Format: `type(scope): description`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
```
feat(providers): add OpenAI-compatible provider
fix(memory): handle SQLite lock on concurrent write
docs(architecture): update Think Box lifecycle
refactor(runtime): extract Planner class from Agent
test(tools): add permission denied tests for shell_exec
```

No commit without a message. No "fix stuff" or "wip" messages in main branch
commits.

### 6.3 What to Commit

- Source code
- Tests
- Documentation
- Configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, etc.)

**Never commit:**
- Secrets, tokens, API keys
- `.env` files
- Model weights or large binaries (use Git LFS or external storage)
- `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`
- IDE config files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)

---

## 7. Git Hygiene

- Commit early, commit often.
- One logical change per commit.
- No merge commits in feature branches (rebase or squash).
- PRs target `main`. Do not push directly to `main`.
- Keep the branch up to date with `main` before opening a PR.

---

## 8. Code Review

- Every PR requires at least one review.
- Reviewers check: architecture compliance, test coverage, documentation,
  security.
- Reviewers do not approve PRs that violate layer discipline or introduce
  undocumented dependencies.

---

## 9. Security Rules

- No secrets in code, config files, or documentation.
- Secrets are injected via environment variables at runtime.
- Tool execution must be permission-checked before it runs.
- Audit logs are append-only and tamper-evident.
- External HTTP calls must have timeouts and retry limits.
- Shell execution must be explicitly approved by the user.

---

## 10. Phase Boundaries

| Phase | Goal | Phase 1 Boundary |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Phase 0 | Foundation | This document |
| Phase 1 | Prove architecture with single agent, single provider, 5 tools | No multi-agent, no benchmarks, no UI |
| Phase 2 | Add pattern extraction, local models, benchmarks | — |
| Phase 3 | Multi-agent, UI, organizational memory scaling | — |

Do not implement Phase 2+ features in Phase 1. Do not implement Phase 1
features before the foundation is solid.

---

## 11. When in Doubt

1. Read `docs/architecture-v1.md`.
2. Read `docs/project-foundation.md`.
3. Check `docs/decisions/` for prior decisions on the topic.
4. If still uncertain, write an ADR before writing code.
5. Default to simplicity. The simplest solution that satisfies the
   architecture is correct.

---

## 13. Environment & Infrastructure

### 13.1 UpCloud (READ ONLY unless Kudbee explicitly says start/stop)

**Rule: Do NOT create, delete, start, stop, resize, or modify servers without explicit Kudbee instruction.**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **UUID** | `00d832ec-8565-447b-86ac-74bf9bd41e57` |
| **Hostname** | `gpu-ubuntu-20cpu-256gb-fi-hel2` |
| **Plan** | GPU-SPOT-20xCPU-256GB-3xL40S |
| **Zone** | fi-hel2 |
| **Floating IP** | 87.58.150.62 |
| **Public NIC** | 87.58.148.168 |
| **Utility IP** | 10.6.21.222 |
| **Template** | Ubuntu 24.04 + NVIDIA/CUDA |
| **SSH Key** | thinkbox-agent (BatchMode only, no interactive) |

**Verify only:**
```bash
curl -s "https://api.upcloud.com/1.3/server" -H "Authorization: Bearer $THINKBOX_UPCLOUD_API_TOKEN"
```

**Spot instances may be powered off by UpCloud. This is not "broken." Do not recreate.**

### 13.2 Upstash Box

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Box ID** | `wanted-tuna-71803` |
| **Status** | resumed/idle |
| **Runtime** | Python 3.13 |
| **Branch** | `session/agent_79e656bf-37c6-46f2-833e-1eb027b99152` |

**Reachability from box:**
- ✅ dogechain.info (403 CF anti-bot, not TLS)
- ✅ api.doginals.org (health endpoint)
- ✅ api.github.com
- ❌ api.inception.ai (CDN SNI reject — never use from box)
- ❌ wonky-ord.dogeord.io (DNS dead)
- ❌ ordinalswallet.com (timeout)

**Model provider on box:** Ollama (preferred) or FreeToken on GPU. Never Inception.

### 13.3 Databases

- **Upstash Redis**: Deleted (saved $25/mo)
- **Upstash Vector**: Empty, left as-is

### 13.4 Cost Constraints

- Budget: ~$340 remaining
- Do NOT create UpCloud CPU boxes ($430/mo unnecessary)
- Do NOT use Inception API (unreachable from box)
- GPU spot may be revoked — this is normal

### 13.5 FreeToken

- Repo: https://github.com/KudbeeZero/kudbee-freetoken
- Purpose: Edge-native MoE serving (250B+ models on consumer GPUs)
- Status: Documented in `data/findings/freetoken_integration.md`
- Not yet deployed. Requires GPU server + Kudbee approval to install.

---

## 14. Enforcement

These rules are enforced by:
- Code review
- CI checks (tests, lint, import ordering)
- Architectural review for cross-layer imports

Violations are bugs. Fix them before merging.
